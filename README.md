# About Me

This is literally about me:

its 04/06/2023

I know i have been gone for a while. But let me tell you guys. Its for a good reason.

First of all, i am sorting my life out. Im doing dopamine detox which means i can't play games, read manga, watch youtube or youtube shorts if its not important, watch anime, and literally anything (Unless it makes me more productive for example watching tutorial video on youtube).

I have been doing it for 3 weeks now. and i feel really good. The first week is torture because i don't ban 1 game and it kills me. Yeah it kills me not literally. And after i ban it, i feel really great and more focused. I have been gone for a while because im doing my thesis and my final exam and im happy to tell you guys that i am back on this journey. I am back to become a great person.

Thanks for anyone who is reading this. I don't know you right now but maybe you will encounter me in the future and read this thing. Just remember that, I exist as a prove that anyone that is struggling with their life right now, You guys can change. Because i changed so much. I can't believe that i wake up at 6 am everyday and workout in the morning and go straight up to take a bath and then do my work. Within this time detox, i realize something. Detoxing is not about a challenge. Its about self improvement.

IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER:
For me, brain is just like your body. If you workout, you will become healthier and you can gain muscle and strength.

REMEMBER, CHANGING IS NOT EASY AND YOU CAN'T JUST CHANGE IN ONE DAY. Your brain need times to develop the strength to overcome so much things. You need to workout your brain so you can feel a change and do better in life. I haven't started studying anything yet, but i'm sure i will study a lot from these days starting now on and im really happy to tell you guys this.

See you guys~

Hello again, its me and im back on writing this. I have stopped detoxing but i still study almost everyday. So here is what i got.

MORE DEPRESSION

Okay thats not entirely right. Im not depressed because i know that each day im getting better. But I still feel that it is not enough and i suck at coding. When the teacher explain about deep neural network. I am like ???? what is this. Why am i so dumb. I really hate being like this and i think to myself. Should i detox again? I think i should no? 

I probably know what i am actually feeling right now. I feel like im studying but because im stagnant again. It feels depressing. My goal to study for at least 5 hours a day. I need to get my shit done. The problem is, i kept waking up so late and sleeping late. Its my own problem yeah i know. Thats why i need to keep striving. I promise to myself, I WILL ACTUALLY STUDY MORE. Because i know that i am incompetent right now. I feel like i got no skills at all. I realize that i can't always feel the change but i am sure that the change is there. Just not apparent enough. I hate myself right now but i know that i can change to be an even better person. See you guys. I will keep updating about myself later on when i reach a certain checkpoint on my life. See you guys.
